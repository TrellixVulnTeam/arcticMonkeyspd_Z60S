        <h4>2002 to 2005: Early years and record deal</h4>
        <!-- el texto es un placeholder por ahora dont judge -->
        <p>The Arctic Monkeys were formed in mid-2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy Nicholson. Turner
            and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in secondary school. Turner, who had
            grown up in a musical household as his father was a music teacher, played guitar in the
            then-instrumental-only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and a new band member, Jamie Cook as
            a second guitarist. The name "Arctic Monkeys" was Cook's idea, and is perhaps a play on "northern monkey", a
            derogatory term for someone from northern England. Initially, Turner was reluctant when it came to being the
            lead singer. As time passed, Turner became the lead singer and frontman of the band as he had "a thing for
            words", according to Helders. The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend and played its
            first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band
            began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now
            known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned onto CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared
            amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The
            first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly,
            as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely
            believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under
            this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying "we never made those demos to make money or
            anything. We were giving them away free anyway – that was a better way for people to hear them."</p>
        <br>
        <p>The band began to grow in popularity across the north of England, receiving attention from BBC Radio and the
            British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the
            music video <a href="https://youtu.be/ePg1tbia9Bg">"Fake Tales of San Francisco"</a>, releasing it on his
            website, alongside the contents of Beneath the Boardwalk – a collection of the band's songs which he named
            after a local music venue. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site, the band said that
            they were unaware of what it was and that the site had originally been created by their fans. In May 2005,
            Arctic Monkeys released the EP Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring
            the songs "Fake Tales of San Francisco" and "From the Ritz to the Rubble". This release was limited to 500
            CDs and 1,000 7" records, but was also available to download from the iTunes Music Store. Soon after, the
            band played at the Carling Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals, reserved for less known or unsigned
            bands.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eventually, they were signed to Domino in June 2005. The band said they were attracted to the DIY ethic of
            Domino owner Laurence Bell, who ran the label from his flat and only signed bands that he liked personally.
            The UK's Daily Star reported that this was followed in October by a £1 million publishing deal with EMI and
            a £725,000 contract with Epic Records for the United States. Arctic Monkeys denied this on their website,
            dubbing the newspaper "The Daily Stir". However, Domino had licensed the Australian and New Zealand
            publishing rights to EMI and the Japanese rights to independent label Hostess. Their debut single <a
                href="https://youtu.be/pK7egZaT3hs">"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"</a> , which was recorded at
            Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire, was released on 17 October 2005 and went straight to No. 1 on the UK Singles
            Chart. Their second single, "When the Sun Goes Down" (previously titled "Scummy"), released on 16 January
            2006, also went straight to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. The band's success with little marketing or
            advertising led some to suggest that it could signal a change in how new bands achieve recognition.</p>
